JH-suite (named according to Jaroslav Heyrovský) is a set of small codes  enabling fast empirical estimations. Each individual program is written in X11-BASIC by Markus Hoffmann (https://github.com/kollokollo/X11Basic) and can be edited by users according to their needs. 

Before use, please read the corresponding manual in the Documents/jh-suite/doc folder.
