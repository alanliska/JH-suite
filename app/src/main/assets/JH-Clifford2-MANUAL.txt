================================================================================
A. BATCH USE
================================================================================
Write the input including the ion types and their counts in the overall formula
of the considered solid entity in the format

Cation,Number of cations,Anion,Number of anions

(i.e. delimiter is comma, no spaces around commas)

as in examples of type:

Fe+3,1,OH-,3
Ca+2,1,Te-2,1
Sb+3,2,S-2,3
Cu+2,1,Cl-,2

Save then the input as JH-Clifford2.inp to the same folder where 
JH-Clifford2.b, JH-Clifford2.dat and JH-Clifford2.par are placed, i.e.
/mnt/sdcard/JH/Program/Clifford2/.

After execution, a new file JH-Clifford2.out is created in the same location. 
If there is any file of this name already present, it will be overwritten. The 
calculation results are inside this file.

The distribution contains one test input and one test output file.
================================================================================
B. INTERACTIVE MODE
================================================================================
If there is no file named JH-Clifford2.inp present in the folder with 
JH-Clifford2.b, the interactive mode of the program is called and the user 
is prompted to input the data via keyboard. Finally, the results will be 
punched again to file JH-Clifford2.out to the same folder.
================================================================================
C. PHREEQC INPUT GENERATOR
================================================================================
The standard output generates input lines for PHREEQC databases in the style
compatible with the version 3. 
================================================================================
D. TROUBLESHOOTING, FEEDBACK
================================================================================
The distributed parameter file JH-Cliford2.par contains following information:
a;b(Compound AaBb);Coeff1;Coeff2;B(Compound AaBb);Clifford´s or Gordy´s
electronegativity of the anionic part for use in the equations

pKs = Coeff1+Coeff2*DeltaX

In case of bugs, any report sent to the authors (alan.liska@jh-inst.cas.cz)
is welcomed.
