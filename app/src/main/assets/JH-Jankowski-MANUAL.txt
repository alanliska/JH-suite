A. BATCH USE
================================================================================
I. Input file

The standard input contains individual lines describing the type and number
of fragments included in the calculated molecule as in the example of
acetate ion (saved as JH-Jankowski.inp to 
/mnt/sdcard/JH/Program/Jankowski/):

-CH3;1
-COO-;1

(please note that the fragment definition is the same as in the database file
JH-Jankowski.dat).

II. Database and other files

The program comes along with some additional files which must be present
in the same folder as JH-Jankowski.b when performing calculations. 
These are (including their structure):

essential:

JH-Jankowski.b (the standalone program)

JH-Jankowski.dat

Group;G(kcal.mol-1)

JH-Jankowski.inp
(this file is modified to obtain the desired results)

and as an example

JH-Jankowski.out
(not necessary to be present, it is generated as a result of the
calculation). 

If the requested fragment is not present in the database file 
JH-Jankowski.dat, it is possible to add manually the missing
data. 
================================================================================
B. INTERACTIVE MODE
================================================================================
As most of programs which deal with structural input data, JH-Jankowski.b
does not support interactive mode as well. It is necessary to input data through
the file named JH-Jankowski.inp present in the same folder as other files. 
================================================================================
C. TROUBLESHOOTING, FEEDBACK
================================================================================
In case of bugs, any report sent to the authors (alan.liska@jh-inst.cas.cz)

================================================================================
E. REVISION HISTORY
================================================================================
1.00 Primary version.
================================================================================
WARNING
================================================================================
Please note that not every molecule property is parametrized within requested
set of group contributions. Therefore, some predicted values can be mislead.
Before further use, please check the file JH-Jankowski.dat for presence of 
needed data.
