A. BATCH USE
================================================================================
I. Input file

The standard input contains individual structure information in the style:

Structural type;Substituent

as in the example

p-Benzoquinone-X;CH(OH)CH3

(please note that both the structural type and substituent definitions are the
same as in the database files JH-Zuman7-Rho.dat and JH-Zuman7-Sigma.dat).

II. Database and other files

The program comes along with some additional files which must be present
in the same folder as JH-Zuman7.b when performing calculations. 
These are (including their structure):

essential:

JH-Zuman7.b (the standalone program)

JH-Zuman7-Rho.dat

Series;Solvent;pH;Mechanism;Ox-Red;Equation;Delta(pi)R;Rho(pi)R;EH(SCE);Remark

JH-Zuman7-Sigma.dat

Group;Sigma_m;Sigma_p;Sigma_o;ES_o;Sigma_p-;Sigma_m+;Sigma_p+;Sigma_I;Sigma_R;
Sigma_star

JH-Zuman7.inp
(this file is modified to obtain the desired results)

and as an example

JH-Zuman7.out
(not necessary to be present, it is generated as a result of the
calculation). 
================================================================================
B. INTERACTIVE MODE
================================================================================
As most of programs which deal with structural input data, JH-Zuman7.b
does not support interactive mode as well. It is necessary to input data through
the file named JH-Zuman7.inp present in the same folder as other files.
